InterfaceLiftDownloader
=======================

Pass the url to download as a command line argument

For example:

python interfacedownloader.py http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper/downloads/date/wide_16:9/2880x1620/


Make sure that the resolution is present in the URL, best way to ensure a correct URL is to go to interfacelift.com and construct the URL there.
